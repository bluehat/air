# Air Notes
It is hard to find good information online about what to do about air quality so here is a collection of sources and information organized together. Pull requests appreciated.

While this information might be applicable to many situations, it is unfortunately currently highly specialized for wild fire smoke.

Referral links benefit the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/).

## tl;dr: here's what a basic loadout might look like. More complete options are in the specialized sections.
### Room filtering
* [Off the shelf option which is good for a smaller space](#user-content-off-the-shelf-hepa-filters)
* [Cheaper DIY option good for a larger space](#user-content-easy-diy-room-wild-fire-air-filter-option)
### Mask
* Just like with COVID, an N95 is the gold standard. Home Depot [stocks them](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3M-9205-N95-Aura-Particulate-Disposable-Respirator-Foldable-10-Pack-9205P-10-DC/316909322) and has a more reputable supply chain than Amazon. Remember that something without a valve is more courteous to others for COVID.
### Optional: Car power inverter
* If you need to evacuate or want to go long distances in a car, especially if you have a pet, you'll want a small appliance for room filtering and an [inverter to run it off your car.](https://www.amazon.com/BESTEK-300W-Power-Inverter-Adapter/dp/B004MDXS0U?tag=electronicfro-20) 

## Air Quality
There are two common ways to measure air quality. One is the various levels of individual particles, and one is an aggregated score called the Air Quality Index, or AQI. For this section, we're mostly going to use AQI.

It's worth remembering that this measures how many particles they are, not how harmful the particles are. There is [some extremely preliminary evidence referenced here](https://thebolditalic.com/understanding-purpleair-vs-airnow-gov-measurements-of-wood-smoke-pollution-562923a55226?gi=775f8a0124e8) that, since wildfires burn up lots of things, that this polution is composed of more harmful particles than normal.
    
### What do these AQI numbers mean?

| Rating | Name (Color Code) | [Health Implications](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi) | Cautionary Statement for [PM2.5](https://aqicn.org/faq/2015-03-15/air-quality-nowcast-a-beginners-guide/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100+ | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (Orange) | "Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected." | "Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion."
| 150+ | Unhealthy (Red) | "Everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects." | "Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid prolonged outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion." |
| 200+ | Very Unhealthy (Purple) | "Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects." | "Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid all outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit outdoor exertion." |
| 300+ | Hazardous (Maroon) | "Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected." | "Everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion." |

### How do I check my AQI?

#### Checking Online
You can check the AQI for your local area online. 

* Here is the [one that loads](http://aqicn.org/here/) It tends to give very optimistic numbers.
* Here is [one operated by the US government](https://www.airnow.gov/)
* Here is the [a crowdsourced option with fantastic data but a less robust website](https://www.purpleair.com) It gives far higher readings. There have been historical instances where these home weather stations were more trustworthy then larger sources.
* Some of these reading differences can be explained and compensated for [in this article](https://thebolditalic.com/understanding-purpleair-vs-airnow-gov-measurements-of-wood-smoke-pollution-562923a55226?gi=775f8a0124e8)
* Please note that many services such as Apple Watch use AQI forecast APIs and many of these are terrible. You are strongly suggested to find actual readings from a sensor from someplace if possible.

#### Measuring Kits
The most exact way to check your AQI is to buy a kit which measures it.

(*this part of the guide is still being developed, please help*)
* Here is [the suggestion from Wirecutter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AWEG0Y?tag=electronicfro-20). It covers "large and small" particles and it is not clear why it is so expensive.
* Here is [one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077HRXWGP?tag=electronicfro-20) which is $100 cheaper and also monitors volitile organic compounds. It isn't clear why it is so much less expensive, especially with the extra sensor.

## Forecasting

It is hard to forecast fires because, like most weather, unknowns compound rapidly. This means that serious decisions should probably not be made based on forecasts. 

If you're asking for when the terrible situation currently around you will stop, a good general rule is to hope for rain.

You can get [detailed forecasts of smoke](https://hwp-viz.gsd.esrl.noaa.gov/smoke/#) from the [NOAA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration) It seems the most relevant term is "near surface smoke."

You can get high-level information about the risk of wildfires from the [National Interagency Fire Center](https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf) That report is updated every month.

## What am I supposed to be doing in general?
The following is summarized from the [EPA's wild fire smoke fact sheet](https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/reduce-your-smoke-exposure.pdf)

The short version is: be in the best quality air you can manage. That generally means, be inside.

### Inside
* Stay inside a building with the windows and doors shut
  * Don't do things that make indoor air quality bad like burning candles, and minimize things like cooking.
  * If it is too hot to keep the windows closed, seek shelter elsewhere
* Improve the quality of the air you breathe
  * Purify the air in your home.
    * Do not use a machine which makes ozone. Ozone is very bad for you. 
  * If your machine can't cover the whole space, go into a smaller space (with no fireplace and ideally few windows) so that your air cleaner doesn't have to keep as much space clean.
* Watch for brief periods of improvement in air quality and, should the quality of the outside air become better than the quality of the inside air, use the opportunity to air out your house.
* Have respirators.
### Outside 
 * Don't exert yourself or otherwise cause yourself to breath hard in bad air.
 * In your car, try to recirculate air rather than bringing new air in.
 * Do not expect bandanas (wet or dry), sawdust masks, or anything that doesn't have the right filter on it, to help.
### Prepare (Ideally beforehand, but better late than never)
 * Minimize how often you have to go out
   * Make sure you have enough medication for a few days
   * Make sure you have some food and water.
 * If you do have to go out, avoid the smokiest parts of the day
 * Have a plan to evacuate
 
## Improving Indoor Air Quality

### What am I trying to filter for?
If you are dealing with wildfire smoke, you are attempting to remove smoke particles, which can be a small as 0.3 microns. 

### What do all of these standards mean?

#### HEPA
HEPA is a standard maintained by the United States Department of Energy (though it was at one point trademarked and then genericised). It requires that you remove 99.97% of all particles 0.3 microns or larger each time air passes through it.

This means it is a very good filter. The problem is that it might take a long time to get all of the air in your house through an appliance which barely creates a breeze and which is also small enough to sit on your coffee table.

#### Furnace System Filters
As a rule, furnace systems do not have HEPA ratings because they have to circulate a lot of air and it is pretty hard to remove so many particles in a single pass. At the same time, most systems that use them will circulate all of the air in your house repeatedly in a relatively short timespan.

##### Furnace filter ratings
* MERV (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value) is the primary rating system used in the industry, both domestically and internationally. Established by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers), MERV rates a filter’s ability to capture and hold particles and pollutants.
* MRV (Micro-Particle Performance Rating) is a rating system designed by 3M for its products. It rates the manufacturer’s filters and their ability to capture airborne particles smaller than 1 micron. It claims that its standards correspond to or improve upon MERV standards, but there is no available evidence to support this.
* FPR (Filter Performance Rating) is a rating system developed by The Home Depot for brands sold through their stores, including Honeywell. It utilizes a color and number scale from 4 to 10 that suspiciously closely resembles MERV rating.

To keep it simple, MERV is subject to testing, and the other two systems are questions of how much you trust the honesty and self-certification practices of large corporations.

##### What MERV rating do I want?
In a tutorial from the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency, MERV 13 is suggested for filtering wildfire smoke (though so was FPR 10). 

In commercial settings, MERV 14 is often the filter used for smoker's lounges.

MERV 15 is suggested for hospital inpatient care, and so probably overkill.

### Methods to improve indoor air ###
#### Off-the-shelf HEPA filters
* [The wirecutter pick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01728NLRG?tag=electronicfro-20) which is a sturdy wonderful little thing. Replacement filters are also relatively cheap and come in large packages. Don't forget to open it up and remove the shrink wrap on the filter. 
* [Some other one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VGIGVY?tag=electronicfro-20) because these start selling out quickly. It meets the specs. 


#### Easy DIY room wild fire air filter option
Adapter found this [credible and easy DIY option.](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/this-diy-air-filter-for-wildfire-smoke-is-less-than-20/281-584346009) The parts here are assuming you get a 20"x20" box fan. It has, to a degree, become the cultural go-to due to its cheap price, easy-to-find replacement filters, and capacity to manage the air in a larger space.
* Materials
  * A box fan
    * Here is [a solidly-built fan](https://www.amazon.com/Lasko-B20301-20-Inch-Premium-3-SPEED/dp/B01CEITGQ4?tag=electronicfro-20) which has the control someplace other than on the back and the cord at the base. This is vastly preferred since the filter doesn't interfere with changing the settings.
    * [The cheapest fan on prime](https://www.amazon.com/Holmes-HBF2001DP-BM-20-Inch-Black-Blade/dp/B00I8Q3082?tag=electronicfro-20). Unfortunately, the power cord and speed control are on the back, which is inconvenient for construction.
  * A [MERV 13](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CR9K33K?tag=electronicfro-20) or FPR 10 filter. We have reason to trust MERV more.
  * Tape. Ideally this would be an air-tight tape, such as [Duct tape](https://www.amazon.com/Multi-Use-Duct-2930-C-Inches-Yards/dp/B0013B1XHE?tag=electronicfro-20). Gaffer tape and gorilla tape are also well-suited to this.
* Construction
  * Tape the air filter to the intake of the box fan.
  * The direction the air is supposed to go should be marked on the filter with and arrow.
  * An airtight seal will help make sure all the box fan draws the air through the filter. This is what the tape is for.
  * If your box fan does have the power cord inconveniently placed on the back, you have two major options
    * Poke holes through the back of the filter to put the plug in and access the speed controller, and then duct tape aggressively around it. This will let you control the speed, but makes replacing the filter highly inconvenient. It is not reccommended.
    * Create a cardboard spacer which moves the filter back from the fan. This lets you plug it in, but doesn't give you access to the speed settings. It is very easy to replace the filter though because you just cut it off the back.
* Usage
  * If you are having trouble keeping the whole house clean, you can just pick a smaller space.
  * Rooms with fewer windows, no fire place, and no vents work better.

#### Way Too Serious
Shelter in place: [instructions](https://www.ready.gov/shelter)
 * Basically, how to seal up a room.
 * You can buy [window and patio door plastic insulation](https://www.amazon.com/Duck-5-Window-Insulator-210-Inch-286217/dp/B000NHY1P0?tag=electronicfro-20) which can function as the sheets to cover vents, windows, and extra doors.
 
## Face Protection (Masks)

* Not everybody can wear masks. Some small children, some pets, and some other respiratory-damaged individuals do not have strong enough lungs to draw new filter into the mask and push old air out.
* In this case, an option is to focus more on handling air quality within a room.
* If you are not worried about anything other than particulates, standard N95's are a fantastic choice and also very effective against COVID. 
  * [Here are some](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3M-9205-N95-Aura-Particulate-Disposable-Respirator-Foldable-10-Pack-9205P-10-DC/316909322) that have a reasonable supply chain and which are available for same-day curbside pickup in most areas of the country. 
  * [Here is a broader selection](https://www.projectn95.org/collections/respirators/) from a more trustworthy supply chain than Amazon with shipping.

### Filters
* Masks are only as good as the seal on your face.
  * You can get more complete facial contact with a paint respirator.
  * Facial hair will hurt the fit of your mask, so if that matters, shave.
* The EPA suggests [N95](https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/reduce-your-smoke-exposure.pdf) - n100 or P95 - [P100](https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/respiratory-protection-508.pdf). 
  * The higher the number, the more particulates are filtered. 
  * The difference between P and N is that P is also oil resistant.
  * P95 masks are strictly better than N95 masks though, depending on the mask, sometimes harder to breathe in casually.
* These filters only remove particles, and not gasses such as CO, CO2, and plastic fumes.

### Cartridges
* Many respirators additionally come with cartridges.
* Thes cartridges are used in industrial settings to filter a variety of gasses, with different specialized cartridges for different applications.
* The United States Forest Service studied face respirators for usage in wildfire fighting. They eventually decided they will only be used voluntarily, and that ["NIOSH-approved respirators could be considered." They list respirators with combination organic vapor/acid gas cartridge and N95 filter.](https://www.fs.fed.us/eng/pubs/pdf/hi_res/07511301hi.pdf)
 
### Current guess on Amazon:
Many options are listed here
* In 2018 when the smoke got severe, Amazon sold out of basically everything
* The cartridges "expire" and technically should not be used after being open for more than a set period. This means that if you followed the letter of the instructions, you might replace them each year.

* Air masks with cartridges
  * With [both organic vapor and acid gas filtering](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Medium-Respirator-Organic-3MR5203/dp/B00LXF98DQ2?tag=electronicfro-20). It is not clear that this mask is compatible with any of the replacement pieces I have been able to find.
  * With [Organic Vapor filtration](https://www.amazon.com/3M-7512PA1-Professional-Respirator-Medium/dp/B000XBFJP2?tag=electronicfro-20) but not acid gas. This particular mask is not suggested by any expert, but it most specs, is compatable with the replacement parts, and is very comfortable to wear and breathe in.
  * Both options are also excellent for obnoxious Bane impressions
* Replacement Pieces
  * [P100 filters with both organic vapor and acid gas filtration](https://www.amazon.com/Cartridge-Filter-60923-Organic-Vapor/dp/B07571LKP3??tag=electronicfro-20).
  * [Cartridges with both organic vapor and acid gas filtration](https://www.amazon.com/3M-50051131070474-Organic-Vapor-Cartridge/dp/B07578JZWG?tag=electronicfro-20) but no filters. 
  * New [P95 filters with organic vapor cartridges](https://www.amazon.com/3M-5P71PB1-6-Particulate-Filters-Pack/dp/B00NTP9MDO?tag=electronicfro-20) but no acid gas.
* Sometimes smoke tastes plasticky
  * Plastic fumes can cause a [wide variety of vapors](https://www.sentryair.com/plastic-fumes.htm)
  * The 3M acid gas cartridges claim to filter the largest subset of them. Acid gas and organic vapor are the two kinds of cartridges suggested by the United States Forest Service. 
  * However, formaldyhide is technically listed on the list of vapors which come from plastic.
  * Here are [formaldihyde and acid gas cartridges](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Low-Maintenance-Cartridge-Purifying-Respirator/dp/B00AEFCP0E?tag=electronicfro-20) without organic vapor filtration. While the option might not be the best for wildfires, other metropolitan areas have been impacted by factory accidents. There may be specific cases where these cartridges are more appropriate.
  * Here is a specific [cartridge for organic vapor and formaldahyde](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Formaldehyde-Cartridge-Respiratory-Protection/dp/B0017DHGTW?tag=electronicfro-20) without acid gas filtration. There is probably an edge case where these are the most relevant option.
