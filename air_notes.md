# Air Notes

Doug took notes and made a list. I asked for a copy because I think he would take good notes and write good lists. You may not need them now, but most don't arrive immediately.

## Should I care?
* There are places where people do care
  * You can see maps of the air
    * Here is the [one that loads](http://aqicn.org/here/)
    * Here is the [much cooler one that doesn't really load right](https://www.purpleair.com/gmap?&zoom=3&lat=39.51596757727815&lng=-99.35539180755615&clustersize=45&orderby=L&latr=134.76294482934054&lngr=-106.875) 
  * Some areas of California have been labeled as "Hazardous" 
* What do these numbers mean?
  * This is the American Lung Organization's chart https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/outdoor/air-pollution/air-quality-index.html
* When will this stop?
  * We are hoping for rain on Wednesday to help with the air quality and possibly reduce sources of air polution.
  
## Credible Easy DIY Option
Adapter found [credible and easy DIY option.](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/this-diy-air-filter-for-wildfire-smoke-is-less-than-20/281-584346009)
You Need
* A box fan
* A MERV 13 or FPR 10 filter.
 
## More Serious
* On face things: The typical safety standards for wildfire is n95- n100 or P95-p100. The difference between P and N is that P is also oil resistant. Notice this only filters out particles and not gasses like CO, or CO2.The problem with the cheaper masks is you need good face contact. P95 masks are strictly better than N95 masks except harder to breathe in casually.
* On room things: Find something HEPA approved and make sure to check if it filters out .3 micron particles. You need to allow the same air to circulate through the purifier more than once preferably in a closed room. Each pass removes 95% of the particles.
### Current guess at Amazon with Saturday delivery:
* [Air Mask](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00079FOK0?tag=electronicfro-20)
  * Not sure this is amazing, it was just around
  * Also excellent for obnoxious Bane impressions
* [Replacement Pieces](https://www.amazon.com/3M-5P71PB1-6-Particulate-Filters-Pack/dp/B00NTP9MDO?tag=electronicfro-20)
  * This one is P, the heavier and harder to breathe through one).
  * That might be unneeded.
