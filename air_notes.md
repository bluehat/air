# Air Notes
It is hard to find good information online about what to do about wildfire smoke, so here is a collection of sources and information organized together. Pull requests appreciated.

## Air Quality
There are two common ways to measure air quality. One is the various levels of individual particles, and one is an aggregated score called the Air Quality Index, or AQI. For this section, we're mostly going to use AQI.
    
### What do these numbers mean?

| Rating | Name (Color Code) | [Health Implications](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi) | Cautionary Statement for [PM2.5](https://aqicn.org/faq/2015-03-15/air-quality-nowcast-a-beginners-guide/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100+ | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (Orange) | "Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected." | "Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion."
| 150+ | Unhealthy (Red) | "Everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects." | "Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid prolonged outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion." |
| 200+ | Very Unhealthy (Purple) | "Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects." | "Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid all outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit outdoor exertion." |
| 300+ | Hazardous (Maroon) | "Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected." | "Everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion." |

### How do I check my AQI?

#### Measuring Kits
The most exact way to check your AQI is to buy a kit which measures it.

(*this part of the guide is still being developed, please help*)
* Here is [the suggestion from Wirecutter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AWEG0Y?tag=electronicfro-20). It covers "large and small" particles and it is not clear why it is so expensive.
* Here is [one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077HRXWGP?tag=electronicfro-20) which is $100 cheaper and also monitors volitile organic compounds. It isn't clear why it is so much less expensive, especially with the extra sensor.

#### Checking Online
You can check the AQI for your local area online.
* Here is the [one that loads](http://aqicn.org/here/) It tends to give very optimistic numbers.
* Here is the [much cooler one that doesn't really load right](https://www.purpleair.com) It gives far higher readings. There have been historical instances where these home weather stations were more trustworthy then larger sources.

## Forecasting

It is hard to forecast fires because, like most weather, unknowns compound rapidly. If you're asking for when the terrible situation currently around you will stop, a good general rule is to hope for rain.

You can get high-level information about the risk of wildfires from the [National Interagency Fire Center](https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf) That report is updated every month.

## What am I supposed to be doing in general?
The following is summarized from the [EPA's fact sheet](https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/reduce-your-smoke-exposure.pdf)

The short version is: be in the best quality air you can manage. That generally means, be inside.

### Inside
* Stay inside a building with the windows and doors shut
  * Don't do things that make indoor air quality bad like burning candles, and minimize things like cooking.
  * If it is too hot to keep the windows closed, seek shelter elsewhere
* Improve the quality of the air you breathe
  * Purify the air in your home.
    * Do not use a machine which makes ozone. Ozone is very bad for you.
  * If your machine can't cover the whole space, go into a smaller space (with no fireplace and ideally few windows) so that your air cleaner doesn't have to keep as much space clean.
* Watch for brief periods of improvement in air quality and, should the quality of the outside air become better than the quality of the inside air, use the opportunity to air out your house.
* Have respirators.
### Outside 
 * Don't exert yourself or otherwise cause yourself to breath hard in bad air.
 * In your car, try to recirculate air rather than bringing new air in.
 * Do not expect bandanas (wet or dry), sawdust masks, or anything that doesn't have the right filter on it, to help.
### Prepare (Ideally beforehand, but better late than never)
 * Minimize how often you have to go out
   * Make sure you have enough medication for a few days
   * Make sure you have some food and water.
 * If you do have to go out, avoid the smokiest parts of the day
 * Have a plan to evacuate
 
## Improving Indoor Air Quality

### Air circulation
How much a filter draws out each cycle is only half of the issue because if it only filters a small amount of air at a time it can wind up helping less than a less efficient filter which circulates far more air.

### What am I trying to filter for?
You are attempting to remove smoke particles, which can be a small as 0.3 microns. 

### HEPA
HEPA is a standard maintained by the United States Department of Energy (though it was at one point trademarked and then genericised). It requires that you remove 99.97% of all particles 0.3 microns or larger each time air passes through it.

This means it is a very good filter. The problem is that it might take a long time to get all of the air in your house through an appliance which barely creates a breeze and which is also small enough to sit on your coffee table.

#### Things with fast delivery which meet the specs:
* [The wirecutter pick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01728NLRG?tag=electronicfro-20) which is a sturdy wonderful little thing. Replacement filters are also relatively cheap and come in large packages. Don't forget to open it up and remove the shrink wrap on the filter. 
* [Some other one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VGIGVY?tag=electronicfro-20) because these start selling out quickly. It meets the specs. 

### Furnace System Filters
As a rule, furnace systems do not have HEPA ratings because they have to circulate a lot of air and it is pretty hard to remove so many particles in a single pass. At the same time, most systems that use them will circulate all of the air in your house repeatedly in a relatively short timespan.

#### What Do All of These Ratings Mean?
* MERV (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value) is the primary rating system used in the industry, both domestically and internationally. Established by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers), MERV rates a filter’s ability to capture and hold particles and pollutants.
* MRV (Micro-Particle Performance Rating) is a rating system designed by 3M for its products. It rates the manufacturer’s filters and their ability to capture airborne particles smaller than 1 micron. It claims that its standards correspond to or improve upon MERV standards, but there is no available evidence to support this.
* FPR (Filter Performance Rating) is a rating system developed by The Home Depot for brands sold through their stores, including Honeywell. It utilizes a color and number scale from 4 to 10 that suspiciously closely resembles MERV rating.

To keep it simple, MERV is subject to testing, and the other two systems are questions of how much you trust the honesty and self-certification practices of large corporations.

#### What MERV rating do I want?
In a tutorial from the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency, MERV 13 is suggested for filtering wildfire smoke (though so was FPR 10). 

In commercial settings, MERV 14 is often the filter used for smoker's lounges.

MERV 15 is suggested for hospital inpatient care, and so probably overkill.

#### Credible Easy DIY Room Air Filter Option
Adapter found this [credible and easy DIY option.](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/this-diy-air-filter-for-wildfire-smoke-is-less-than-20/281-584346009) The parts here are assuming you get a 20"x20" box fan.
* Materials
  * A [box fan](https://www.amazon.com/Holmes-HBF2001DP-BM-20-Inch-Black-Blade/dp/B00I8Q3082?tag=electronicfro-20). This one is the cheapest fan on prime. Unfortunately, the power cord and speed control are on the back, which is inconvenient for construction.
  * A [MERV 13](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CR9K33K?tag=electronicfro-20) or FPR 10 filter. We have reason to trust MERV more.
  * Tape. Ideally this would be an air-tight tape, such as duct tape. Gaffer tape and gorilla tape are also well-suited to this.
* Construction
  * Tape the air filter to the intake of the box fan.
  * The direction the air is supposed to go should be marked on the filter with and arrow.
  * An airtight seal will help make sure all the box fan draws the air through the filter.
  * Fans with the power plugs and speed controls not on the back are better suited for this.
  * If your box fan does have the speed control, you have two major options
    * Poke holes through the back of the filter to put the plug in and access the speed controller. This will let you control the speed, but makes replacing the filter highly inconvenient.
    * Create a cardboard spacer which moves the filter back from the fan. This lets you plug it in, but often makes it hard to access the speed control. It is very easy to replace the filter though because you just cut it off the back.
* Usage
  * If you are having trouble keeping the whole house clean, you can just pick a smaller space.
  * Rooms with fewer windows, no fire place, and no vents work better.

### Way Too Serious
Shelter in place: [instructions](https://www.ready.gov/shelter)
 * Basically, how to seal up a room.
 * You can buy [window and patio door plastic insulation](https://www.amazon.com/Duck-5-Window-Insulator-210-Inch-286217/dp/B000NHY1P0?tag=electronicfro-20) which can function as the sheets to cover vents, windows, and extra doors.
 
## Face Protection
The typical safety standards for wildfire is n95- n100 or P95-p100. The difference between P and N is that P is also oil resistant. Notice this only filters out particles and not gasses like CO, or CO2. The problem with the cheaper masks is you need good face contact. P95 masks are strictly better than N95 masks though, depending on the mask, sometimes harder to breathe in casually. Facial hair will hurt the fit of your mask, so if that matters, shave. 

[N95](https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/reduce-your-smoke-exposure.pdf) or [P100](https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/respiratory-protection-508.pdf) is what is suggested by the EPA.

The United States Forest Service studied face respirators for usage in wildfire fighting. They eventually decided they will only be used voluntarily, and that ["NIOSH-approved respirators could be considered." They list respirators with combination organic vapor/acid gas cartridge and N95 filter.](https://www.fs.fed.us/eng/pubs/pdf/hi_res/07511301hi.pdf)
 
### Current guess at Amazon:
* [Air Mask](https://www.amazon.com/3M-7512PA1-Professional-Respirator-Medium/dp/B000XBFJP2?tag=electronicfro-20)
  * Not sure this is amazing, it was just around and met all the basic specs.
  * It is incredibly comfortable to wear though. You will know there is something on your face due to the physical weight, but not from how warm it is or how difficult it is to inhale.
  * This includes cartridges with organic vapor cartridges, but not acid gas.
  * Also excellent for obnoxious Bane impressions
* [Replacement Pieces](https://www.amazon.com/3M-5P71PB1-6-Particulate-Filters-Pack/dp/B00NTP9MDO?tag=electronicfro-20)
  * This contains P95 filters.
  * It also contains a new set of cartridges for the organic vapor, but not for acid gas.

## What About Avoiding Actual Fire?
