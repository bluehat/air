## Should I care?
* There are places where people do care.
  * Some areas of California have been labeled as "Hazardous" (Maroon).
* You should probably check if you live in one of those places,
  * You can see maps of the air.
    * Here is the [one that loads](http://aqicn.org/here/) It tends to give very optimistic numbers.
    * Here is the [much cooler one that doesn't really load right](https://www.purpleair.com/gmap?&zoom=3&lat=39.51596757727815&lng=-99.35539180755615&clustersize=45&orderby=L&latr=134.76294482934054&lngr=-106.875) It gives far higher readings. There have been historical instances where these home weather stations were more trustworthy then larger sources.
* What do these numbers mean?

| 300+ | Hazardous (Maroon) | "Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected." | "Everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion." |

* When will this stop?
  * We are hoping for rain on Wednesday. Rain would help improve the air quality and possibly also reduce sources of air. polution.

## [What am I supposed to be doing in general?](https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/reduce-your-smoke-exposure.pdf)
  
## Credible Easy DIY Room Air Filter Option
Adapter found this [credible and easy DIY option.](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/this-diy-air-filter-for-wildfire-smoke-is-less-than-20/281-584346009)
* You Need
  * A box fan
  * A MERV 13 or FPR 10 filter for a forced air system, such as a heating system.
* Basically by taping the air filter to the box fan and running it in a smaller room, ideally with few windows, you are causing a lot of bad things from the air to get stuck in the filter.
 
## More Serious
* On face things: The typical safety standards for wildfire is n95- n100 or P95-p100. The difference between P and N is that P is also oil resistant. Notice this only filters out particles and not gasses like CO, or CO2. The problem with the cheaper masks is you need good face contact. P95 masks are strictly better than N95 masks except harder to breathe in casually. Facial hair will hurt the fit of your mask, so if that matters, shave.
* On room things: Find something HEPA approved and make sure to check if it filters out .3 micron particles. You need to allow the same air to circulate through the purifier more than once preferably in a closed room. Each pass through hthe suggested level of filtering removes 95% of the particles.
### Current guess at Amazon with Saturday delivery:
* [Air Mask](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00079FOK0?tag=electronicfro-20)
  * Not sure this is amazing, it was just around.
  * Also excellent for obnoxious Bane impressions
* [Replacement Pieces](https://www.amazon.com/3M-5P71PB1-6-Particulate-Filters-Pack/dp/B00NTP9MDO?tag=electronicfro-20)
  * This one is P, the heavier and harder to breathe through one).
  * Now that we have researched it more, the N is likely the wiser choice.

## Way Too Serious
Shelter in place: [instructions](https://www.ready.gov/shelter)
 * Basically, how to seal up a room.
