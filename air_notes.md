# Air Notes
It is hard to find good information online about what to do about wildfire smoke, so here is a collection of sources and information organized together. Pull requests appreciated.

## Air Quality
There are two common ways to measure air quality. One is the various levels of individual particles, and one is an aggregated score called the Air Quality Index, or AQI. For this section, we're mostly going to use AQI.

### How do I check my AQI?
The most exact way to check your AQI is to buy a kit which measures it.

You can check the AQI for your local area online.
    * Here is the [one that loads](http://aqicn.org/here/) It tends to give very optimistic numbers.
    * Here is the [much cooler one that doesn't really load right](https://www.purpleair.com/gmap?&zoom=3&lat=39.51596757727815&lng=-99.35539180755615&clustersize=45&orderby=L&latr=134.76294482934054&lngr=-106.875) It gives far higher readings. There have been historical instances where these home weather stations were more trustworthy then larger sources.
    
### What do these numbers mean?

| Rating | Name (Color Code) | [Health Implications](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi) | Cautionary Statement for [PM2.5](https://aqicn.org/faq/2015-03-15/air-quality-nowcast-a-beginners-guide/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100+ | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (Orange) | "Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected." | "Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion."
| 150+ | Unhealthy (Red) | "Everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects." | "Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid prolonged outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion." |
| 200+ | Very Unhealthy (Purple) | "Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects." | "Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid all outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit outdoor exertion." |
| 300+ | Hazardous (Maroon) | "Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected." | "Everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion." |

### When will my AQI improve?
That isn't an easy thing to know, but as a general rule, hope for rain.

## What am I supposed to be doing in general?
The following is summarized from the [EPA's fact sheet](https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/smoke_fires/reduce-your-smoke-exposure.pdf): 
Inside
* Be in the best quality air you can manage:
  * Stay inside a building with the windows and doors shut
    * Don't do things that make indoor air quality bad like burning candles, and minimize things like cooking.
    * If it is too hot to keep the windows closed, seek shelter elsewhere
  * Improve the quality of the air you breathe
    * Purify the air in your home.
      * Do not use a machine which makes ozone. Ozone is very bad for you.
    * If your machine can't cover the whole space, go into a smaller space (with no fireplace and ideally few windows) so that your air cleaner doesn't have to keep as much space clean.
  * Watch for brief periods of improvement in air quality and, should the quality of the outside air become better than the quality of the inside air, use the opportunity to air out your house.
  * Have respirators.
Outside 
 * Don't exert yourself or otherwise cause yourself to breath hard in bad air.
 * In your car, try to recirculate air rather than bringing new air in.
Prepare (Ideally beforehand, but better late than never)
 * Minimize how often you have to go out
   * Make sure you have enough medication for a few days
   * Make sure you have some food and water.
 * If you do have to go out, avoid the smokiest parts of the day
 * Have a plan to evacuate
 
## Improving Indoor Air Quality
Find something HEPA approved and make sure to check if it filters out .3 micron particles. You need to allow the same air to circulate through the purifier more than once preferably in a closed room. Each pass through hthe suggested level of filtering removes 95% of the particles.

### Credible Easy DIY Room Air Filter Option
Adapter found this [credible and easy DIY option.](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/this-diy-air-filter-for-wildfire-smoke-is-less-than-20/281-584346009)
* You Need
  * A box fan
  * A MERV 13 or FPR 10 filter for a forced air system, such as a heating system filter.
* Basically by taping the air filter to the box fan and running it in a smaller room, ideally with few windows, you are causing a lot of bad things from the air to get stuck in the filter.

### Current guess at Amazon:
* [Room filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VGIGVY?tag=electronicfro-20)
 
## Face Protection
The typical safety standards for wildfire is n95- n100 or P95-p100. The difference between P and N is that P is also oil resistant. Notice this only filters out particles and not gasses like CO, or CO2. The problem with the cheaper masks is you need good face contact. P95 masks are strictly better than N95 masks except harder to breathe in casually. Facial hair will hurt the fit of your mask, so if that matters, shave. 
 
### Current guess at Amazon:
* [Air Mask](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00079FOK0?tag=electronicfro-20)
  * Not sure this is amazing, it was just around.
  * Also excellent for obnoxious Bane impressions
* [Replacement Pieces](https://www.amazon.com/3M-5P71PB1-6-Particulate-Filters-Pack/dp/B00NTP9MDO?tag=electronicfro-20)
  * This one is P, the heavier and harder to breathe through one).
  * Now that we have researched it more, the N is likely the wiser choice.

## Way Too Serious
Shelter in place: [instructions](https://www.ready.gov/shelter)
 * Basically, how to seal up a room.

## What About Avoiding Actual Fire?
You can see which wildfires are burning and which have been contained at http://www.fire.ca.gov/general/firemaps

Each Cal Fire county tends to have its own twitter feed, and this is often an OK place to get updates for your local area.
